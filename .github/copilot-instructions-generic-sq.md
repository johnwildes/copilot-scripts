# Copilot Instructions for Generating High-Quality Code

## Objective
This document provides guidelines for using Copilot to generate code that adheres to best practices and achieves higher SonarQube scores.

## General Guidelines
1. **Follow Coding Standards**: Ensure the code adheres to the language-specific coding standards (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, Java Code Conventions).
2. **Maintain Readability**: Write clear, readable, and maintainable code. Use meaningful variable and function names.
3. **Commenting and Documentation**: Include comments and documentation to explain complex logic and usage of functions and classes.
4. **GitHub Copilot identification**: Include "Generated by GitHub Copilot" within the comments at the beginning and end of a code block suggestion.

## Specific Practices for Higher SonarQube Scores

### Code Quality
- **Avoid Code Smells**: Refactor code to eliminate common code smells such as long methods, large classes, and duplicated code.
- **Complexity Management**: Keep cyclomatic complexity low by breaking down large functions into smaller, manageable ones.
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling using try-catch blocks and avoid empty catch blocks.

### Security
- **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Secure Coding Practices**: Follow secure coding practices, including the use of prepared statements and avoiding hard-coded credentials.

### Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Write comprehensive unit tests to cover all possible edge cases and ensure code reliability.
- **Code Coverage**: Aim for high code coverage by writing tests for all critical paths in the code.

### Performance
- **Optimize Performance**: Identify and optimize performance bottlenecks. Use efficient algorithms and data structures.
- **Resource Management**: Ensure proper management of resources such as memory, file handles, and database connections.

## Example Code Snippets

### Python Example
```python
def calculate_sum(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the sum of a list of numbers.

    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of the numbers.
    """
    if not all(isinstance(num, (int, float)) for num in numbers):
        raise ValueError("All elements must be numbers")
    
    return sum(numbers)
