# Copilot Instructions for Generating High-Quality C# Code

## Objective
This document provides guidelines for using Copilot to generate C# code that adheres to best practices and achieves higher SonarQube scores.

## General Guidelines
1. **Follow Coding Standards**: Ensure the code adheres to C# coding standards (e.g., naming conventions, formatting).
2. **Maintain Readability**: Write clear, readable, and maintainable code. Use meaningful variable and method names.
3. **Commenting and Documentation**: Include comments and XML documentation to explain complex logic and usage of methods and classes.
4. **GitHub Copilot identification**: Include "Generated by GitHub Copilot" within the comments at the beginning and end of a code block suggestion.

## Specific Practices for Higher SonarQube Scores

### Code Quality
- **Avoid Code Smells**: Refactor code to eliminate common code smells such as long methods, large classes, and duplicated code.
- **Complexity Management**: Keep cyclomatic complexity low by breaking down large methods into smaller, manageable ones.
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling using try-catch blocks and avoid empty catch blocks.

### Security
- **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Secure Coding Practices**: Follow secure coding practices, including the use of parameterized queries and avoiding hard-coded credentials.

### Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Write comprehensive unit tests to cover all possible edge cases and ensure code reliability.
- **Code Coverage**: Aim for high code coverage by writing tests for all critical paths in the code.

### Performance
- **Optimize Performance**: Identify and optimize performance bottlenecks. Use efficient algorithms and data structures.
- **Resource Management**: Ensure proper management of resources such as memory, file handles, and database connections.

## Example Code Snippets

### C# Example
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class Calculator
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Calculate the sum of a list of numbers.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="numbers">A list of numbers.</param>
    /// <returns>The sum of the numbers.</returns>
    public static double CalculateSum(List<double> numbers)
    {
        if (numbers == null)
        {
            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(numbers), "Input cannot be null");
        }

        foreach (var num in numbers)
        {
            if (double.IsNaN(num))
            {
                throw new ArgumentException("All elements must be valid numbers");
            }
        }

        double sum = 0;
        foreach (var num in numbers)
        {
            sum += num;
        }

        return sum;
    }
}
```
