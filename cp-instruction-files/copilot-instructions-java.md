# Copilot Instructions for Generating High-Quality Java Code

## Objective
This document provides guidelines for using Copilot to generate Java code that adheres to best practices and achieves higher SonarQube scores.

## General Guidelines
1. **Follow Coding Standards**: Ensure the code adheres to Java coding standards (e.g., naming conventions, formatting).
2. **Maintain Readability**: Write clear, readable, and maintainable code. Use meaningful variable and method names.
3. **Commenting and Documentation**: Include comments and Javadoc to explain complex logic and usage of methods and classes.
4. **GitHub Copilot identification**: Include "Generated by GitHub Copilot" within the comments at the beginning and end of a code block suggestion.

## Specific Practices for Higher SonarQube Scores

### Code Quality
- **Avoid Code Smells**: Refactor code to eliminate common code smells such as long methods, large classes, and duplicated code.
- **Complexity Management**: Keep cyclomatic complexity low by breaking down large methods into smaller, manageable ones.
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling using try-catch blocks and avoid empty catch blocks.

### Security
- **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Secure Coding Practices**: Follow secure coding practices, including the use of prepared statements and avoiding hard-coded credentials.

### Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Write comprehensive unit tests to cover all possible edge cases and ensure code reliability.
- **Code Coverage**: Aim for high code coverage by writing tests for all critical paths in the code.

### Performance
- **Optimize Performance**: Identify and optimize performance bottlenecks. Use efficient algorithms and data structures.
- **Resource Management**: Ensure proper management of resources such as memory, file handles, and database connections.

## Example Code Snippets

### Java Example
```java
// Generated by GitHub Copilot
import java.util.List;

public class Calculator {
    /**
     * Calculate the sum of a list of numbers.
     *
     * @param numbers A list of numbers.
     * @return The sum of the numbers.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the input list is null or contains invalid numbers.
     */
    public static double calculateSum(List<Double> numbers) {
        if (numbers == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Input cannot be null");
        }

        for (Double num : numbers) {
            if (num == null || Double.isNaN(num)) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("All elements must be valid numbers");
            }
        }

        double sum = 0;
        for (Double num : numbers) {
            sum += num;
        }

        return sum;
    }
}
