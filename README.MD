# Copilot Scripts

## Description

This repository contains a random assortment of functions and code that I've created using GitHub Copilot.  I've spent upwards of 30 years doing IT related things, some writing code, others doing different technical jobs.  I envy those who have their entire skillset in being able to do software development.  In my world being able to use Copilot to solve some quick challenges is all I get.  I'm sure as time goes on there will be some more interesting things that end up in this repo but for now, you have a glimpse of what it is that I've used it for.
